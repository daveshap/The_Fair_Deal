# The Fair Deal

## What is The Fair Deal?

The Fair Deal is primarily a *new social contract* with these characteristics:

1. **A New Social Contract:** A fresh vision inspired by the Square Deal and New Deal, capturing contemporary principles and understanding for a more just future.
2. **Based on Core Principles:** Grounded in high individual liberty, social mobility, and standard of living; informed by psychological theories of universal human needs.
3. **Global Nonpartisan Initiative:** An inclusive, nonpartisan effort to shape a new social contract, inviting diverse contributions. Aimed not just at America, but the entirety of humanity.
4. **Building Consensus:** A commitment to gradual, thoughtful change, nurturing consensus across political, economic, social, cultural, and intellectual spheres.

## Core Principles

The Fair Deal is predicated upon these principles. Everything should flow from this core framework.

1. High **Individual Liberty** for all humans
2. High **Standard of Living** for all humans
3. High **Social Mobility** for all humans

## Universal Human Needs

Through rigorous research and distilling of multiple frameworks and perspectives, these are the universal human needs. While the Fair Deal is not meant to provide them directly, the Fair Deal creates the optimal environment for thriving. In other words, the aforementioned three principles, when applied broadly, facilitate and enable people to meet their universal needs. 

1. **Basic Needs:** Includes physiological needs and safety, emphasizing survival and security.
2. **Love and Belonging:** A recurring theme that highlights connection and relationships.
3. **Autonomy and Freedom:** A focus on individual choice, control, and the ability to pursue one's path.
4. **Growth and Self-Actualization:** Concerns personal development, competence, and reaching one's potential.
5. **Well-Being:** Encompasses mental and physical health, relaxation, and overall wellness.

## General Strategy

These four strategic principles can allow anyone to participate in spreading the ideas of the New Deal. Like any intellectual, political, or philosophical movement, it will take time. These are four strategic behaviors that anyone can do, starting right now.

1. **Initiate Conversation:** Engage people in dialogue about these universal principles. Explore agreement, objections, likes, and dislikes to craft organic narratives. Negotiate and compromise.
2. **Research and Messaging:** Encourage academics, politicians, and communicators to dissect, discuss, and name these ideas, creating a robust intellectual framework. Teach it, understand it.
3. **Incorporate into Culture:** Urge creators, influencers, and storytellers to weave these principles into their works and missions, recognizing the power of timely ideas and compelling stories.
4. **Spread and Embed:** Allow the idea to resonate, spread, and become part of the zeitgeist. Naturally, champions will emerge, and it will influence policy and societal norms.

## Cautions

Political and social ideologies can be extremely harmful when misapplied or misunderstood. 

1. **Don't put the cart before the horse.** There's a correct order of things here. You can't force an organic narrative anymore than you can change wind and tide. You have to go with the flow.
2. **Ends don't justify means.** Some of the worst atrocities in humanity were because someone had an idealized view of society and humanity and used brute force to try and make it happen. 
3. **Progress is not linear.** Systemic change requires systemic efforts, and patience. Grassroots movements always feel glacial, but they can take years or decades to pick up steam, and then the change happens all at once. Be ready for narrative and counter-narrative.

## Underpinning Theories and Models

For reference, these six frameworks serve as the primary underpinning research behind The Fair Deal. 

1. **Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs:** A psychological theory that describes five levels of human needs, arranged in a pyramid. From bottom to top, the levels are: physiological, safety, love/belonging, esteem, and self-actualization. The lower needs must be satisfied before higher-level needs become motivating.
2. **Choice Theory:** Developed by Dr. William Glasser, Choice Theory posits that human behavior is driven by the choices made to satisfy five basic needs: survival, love/belonging, power, freedom, and fun. It emphasizes personal responsibility and the idea that the only person's behavior we can control is our own.
3. **Self-Determination Theory (SDT):** A theory of motivation that focuses on the degree to which human behavior is self-motivated and self-determined. It centers around three basic psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Fulfilling these needs leads to optimal development and well-being.
4. **Roger Walsh's Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC):** A set of evidence-based lifestyle therapeutic practices that aim to enhance mental health and well-being. It includes exercise, nutrition, exposure to nature, relationships, recreation, relaxation, religious/spiritual engagement, and contribution and service.
5. **Kohlberg's Theory of Moral Development:** A stage theory describing the development of moral reasoning. It consists of three levels, each with two stages: Pre-conventional (obedience, self-interest), Conventional (interpersonal accord, authority), and Post-conventional (social contract, universal ethical principles).
6. **Kegan's Self-Authorship:** A developmental theory by Robert Kegan that focuses on how individuals construct and evolve their understanding of the world through six stages. It emphasizes the progression from being subject to one's context to achieving a sense of self-authorship, where individuals can act independently from their surroundings. The final stages, Self-Authorship and Self-Transforming minds, understand their perspective in the context of numerous other perspectives and worldviews. Itâ€™s about disentangling oneself from the noise to see the bigger picture.

## Understanding Social Contract

It's important to understand that The Fair Deal is not a legislative package, but rather a new narrative, a new social contract. The ultimate result should include policy changes, fiscal changes, and monetary changes. But it should also include a new understanding of the relationships, responsibilities, and expectations from the various pillars of society.

- **Social Contract:** An implicit or explicit agreement among members of a society to cooperate for mutual benefit, often involving negotiation and compromise to balance individual and collective needs, wants, values, and rights. Some features of Social Contract:
  - **Consensus:** Social contracts work towards consensus through negotiation and compromise.
  - **Narrative:** Consensus is achieved through narratives and stories. A social contract is a type of narrative.
  - **Belief:** People have to believe in the social contract for it to work. Cultivating belief is a matter of evidence, time, reflection, and observation.
  - **Universal Principles:** The social contract must appeal to universal principles. Prior social contracts were based upon prevailing philosophy and economic theory of the time.
  - **Zeitgeist:** Social contract is embedded within and constructed along with the zeitgeist. It is as much a reflection of the times as it is a shaper.
- **Pillars of Society:** A social contract underscores a set of expectations, roles, and responsibilities placed upon the various pillars of society. This is crucial to solving the coordination problem, which allows for large, complex societies to exist.
  - **The People:** Social contracts are, first and foremost, of the people, for the people, and by the people.
  - **Government:** Secondarily, social contracts establish the role of government, including expectations, constraints, and goals. This can include entities such as central banks, military, Congress, Courts, and other constructs of government. This excludes religious institutions as we have globally agreed that secular government is ideal.
  - **Business:** A third pillar of social contract is business; the entities, institutions and instruments of society that produce goods and services. This can include numerous categories, such as banks, media, and journalists.
